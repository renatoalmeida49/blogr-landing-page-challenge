## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://relaxed-brattain-ee9604.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The HTML Semantic, even starting from a mobile desing, must be planned with careful. I had to change de semantic when I started to develop for a desktop version.

### Continued development

The hover effect on the menu for the desktop version doesn't work and the mobile menu too. Maybe I should split the CSS file in several others, to simplify and have a better organization.
